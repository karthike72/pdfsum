I aim to develop a multifunctional PDF management website that provides a wide range of tools for handling PDF documents. The website will offer features for converting files to and from PDF formats, merging and splitting PDFs, compressing files, and performing various edits and annotations. Designed for convenience and accessibility, the site will allow me to efficiently manage PDF tasks at any time and from any location. My goal is to create a comprehensive, user-friendly platform that centralizes all my PDF-related needs, making it an essential tool for my daily work.
